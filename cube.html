    <h1>Interactive 3D Cube</h1>
    <p>Click and drag to rotate, use your mouse wheel or pinch to zoom. On a mobile device, tap the AR icon in the bottom right to place the cube in your world!</p>
    
    <!-- 
      This is the <model-viewer> element.
      It's a custom HTML tag that handles all the 3D rendering and interaction.
      Let's break down the attributes:
      
      src="...":         This points to the 3D model file. We are using a simple cube .gltf file hosted on a CDN.
                         To use your own model, just replace this URL.
                         
      alt="...":         A description for screen readers, for accessibility.
      
      auto-rotate:       Makes the cube slowly rotate on its own.
      
      camera-controls:   This is the magic attribute that enables rotation (drag),
                         zooming (scroll/pinch), and panning (right-click-drag).
                         
      ar:                Enables the Augmented Reality feature, which shows the "View in AR" button
                         on supported devices (mostly modern mobile phones).
                         
      ar-modes="...":    Specifies the types of AR experiences to offer. 'webxr' is for browsers that
                         support the WebXR API (like Chrome on Android). 'scene-viewer' and 'quick-look'
                         are for native AR viewers on Android and iOS respectively.
                         
      shadow-intensity:  Controls how dark the shadow under the model is.
      
      environment-image: Sets a neutral lighting environment for realistic reflections. 'neutral' is a built-in option.
